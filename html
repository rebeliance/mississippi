                    <strong>Sarah's Story - Yazoo City:</strong> Sarah works full-time at the chicken processing plant for $11.50/hour ($23,920/year). Her rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $750/month. After utilities ($180), car payment ($250), insurance ($120), and gas ($150), she has $470 left each month to feed and clothe her three kids, buy medicine when they're sick, and handle any emergency. Last month, her car broke down. The $400 repair meant choosing between fixing it to keep her job or buying groceries. The food bank helped, but she still had to send her kids to school hungry three days that week.

                    <strong>James's Reality - Clarksdale:</strong> James owns a small auto repair shop that his father started 40 years ago. He employs three people but can only pay them $10/hour because business has dropped 40% since the factory closed. He hasn't taken a salary in six months, living off his savings to keep his employees paid. He's one major equipment breakdown away from closing permanently.

                <p><strong>The Ripple Effect:</strong> When families can't afford basics, local businesses lose customers. When businesses close, jobs disappear. When jobs disappear, young people leave. It's a cycle that's been draining Mississippi communities for decades. In the Delta alone, we've lost 68,000 residents since 2010â€”that's entire towns worth of teachers, nurses, entrepreneurs, and families.</p>

Rural ambulance services are shutting down too. In Calhoun County, there's one ambulance for 14,500 people. If you have a heart attack during another emergency, you wait.</p>

She leaves home at 5:45 AM and doesn't return until 5 PM. She's too tired for homework most nights, and her grades are slipping. Her mom can't helpâ€”she works two jobs and never finished high school herself.

Even now, his homework requires internet the family can't afford ($140/month for satellite internet is their only option). His teacher prints extra copies, but Timothy knows he's falling behind kids in towns with broadband.

                <p><strong>Long-term Impact:</strong> Mississippi students who don't read proficiently by 3rd grade are four times more likely to drop out. Our 17% dropout rate means 5,100 students leave school each year without diplomas. Their lifetime earnings will be $300,000 less than graduates. That's $1.5 billion in lost economic potential every single year.</p>

Washington's PTA raises $200,000 annually. Coleman's raises $3,000. Property valuesâ€”and thus local school fundingâ€”reflect decades of residential segregation.

            <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Mississippi has access to over $8 billion in federal funds already allocated but not yet spent. Combined with strategic state investments and public-private partnerships, we can transform our state without breaking the budget. Every dollar invested in education returns $7 in economic growth. Every dollar in infrastructure returns $3. This isn't spendingâ€”it's investing in Mississippi's future.</p>
